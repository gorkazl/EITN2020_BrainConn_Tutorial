    "**Random graphs** are the 1st-order reference network model. It is a well-known fact that the numerical outcome of all graph metrics strongly depends on how sparse, or how dense the network is (i.e., on the size N and number of links L.) This makes network comparison a difficult challenge. Random graphs are the network models with the least number of constraints (N and L) and only one assumption: that every link has been seeded independently, at random.\n",

    "Beyond N and L, we often want to know how much do the observed metrics depend on a third constraint: the degree-distribution. Specially because the presence of hubs may strongly influence other properties. To explore that, we can generate reference graphs with the same N, L and degree-sequence as the original network, which are maximally random under those constraints. Because of the additional constraint, these are 2nd-order reference graphs. We can construct such networks by randomly rewiring the links of the original network, carefully conserving the given constraints.\n",

    "Usually, functional connectivity is estimated from dynamic / statistic measures from the pairwise  temporal activities of two brain regions. Here, we don't have fMRI or EEG data from the brain of cats so, for illustration purposes, we will compute an analytical estimate (a prediction) of its FC. This estimate, *Topological Similarity*, is based on a diffusion process along the network. The details of the estimate are found in:\n",
